summary			"A CLI utility to create Haiku widgets"
Description			"yabdialog is a CLI utility that displays a variety of dialogs, alerts and panels with more control over color and placement than you get with the standard Haiku alert and filepanel commands. It also contains additional widgets and lets you control your system clipboard. The yabdialog command should be  callable from any scripting language that can issue a SYSTEM call and receive string data back from standard input. All parameters must be supplied, in the correct order. Some error-checking is performed, but things will get unpredictable if you swop parameters. On the bright side, all parameters are case-insensitive.

This utility was once known as hdialog, but I found out someone else was using the name. I'm not interested in getting into a big fight over who used it first, and the other one looks more compatable with xdialog, so I'm changing the name of my app. If you have been using my version of hdialog in your scripts, please uninstall that and change all references in your scripts to yabdialog.
